<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Nefarious</h3>
<p>This is my favorite scary movie. It's about an atheist therapist interviewing a demon-possessed man.</p>

<h3>Sound of Freedom</h3>
<p>This is my favorite thriller movie. It's about how a man takes a leap of faith to make a difference ending child trafficking.</p>

<h3>The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe</h3>
<p>This is a metaphoric movie about the gospel.</p>
